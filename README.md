# EPL-Match-Winner-Prediction

I have referred the following YouTube video for this project: https://youtu.be/0irmDBWLrco?si=nKWSEp6rkg8o_Wvl

I have used Random Forest algorithm to predict the winners of football matches. Various stats such as goals, assists, shots, shots on target etc have been considered to predict the winner. Currently the model predicts winner with 62% precision.
